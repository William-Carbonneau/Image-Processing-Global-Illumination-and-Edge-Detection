A note on numerical text inputs:
Some text boxes allow for numerical input. This can be in the form of a floating point number (negative or non-negative), or of an integer. The user should be able to freely modify these inputs, but any invalid keystrokes (like letters) will not go through. Furthermore, the user will be unable to delete a digit if such an oparation would leave an invalid number in its place. Highlight the number and type over the highlighted part to override it (if it helps).

Poem:
 
In the realm of creativity's dance, where teams of visionaries take their chance, there exists a group, a spectral blend, whose name, a story, they seek to send.

Behold the Chroma Chameleons, a troupe adorned with hues unknown, masters of light and shadow's art, weaving wonders, a symphony's start.

In the labyrinth of pixels, they roam, each member a prism, casting their own tone, with every stroke and every stroke, they mold the canvas, a kaleidoscope.

Chameleons they are, ever-changing, adapting to the challenges engaging, their palette vast, their skills refined, in the realm of imagery, they're enshrined.

With whispers of algorithms and algorithms deep, they navigate the digital keep, harmonizing science with art's embrace, revealing beauty in every trace.

Their name, a reflection of their craft, shifting hues in a ceaseless draft, from vibrant reds to tranquil blues, they paint the world, an ever-changing muse.

So let us hail the Chroma Chameleons, in their quest, their journey unfolds, for in the realm of image and light, they reign supreme, a beacon bright.

They may get hurt along the way, for their project is like a dragon, but in the end, they emerge on the other side, as victorious as a salmon.
