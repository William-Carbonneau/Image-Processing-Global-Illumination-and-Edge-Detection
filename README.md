# Image Processing Global Illumination and Edge Detection

## A project for "Integrative Project in Computer Science", focusing in 3D rendering using global illumination and image processing by convolutions and edge detection.






 
In the realm of creativity's dance, where teams of visionaries take their chance, there exists a group, a spectral blend, whose name, a story, they seek to send.

Behold the Chroma Chameleons, a troupe adorned with hues unknown, masters of light and shadow's art, weaving wonders, a symphony's start.

In the labyrinth of pixels, they roam, each member a prism, casting their own tone, with every stroke and every stroke, they mold the canvas, a kaleidoscope.

Chameleons they are, ever-changing, adapting to the challenges engaging, their palette vast, their skills refined, in the realm of imagery, they're enshrined.

With whispers of algorithms and algorithms deep, they navigate the digital keep, harmonizing science with art's embrace, revealing beauty in every trace.

Their name, a reflection of their craft, shifting hues in a ceaseless draft, from vibrant reds to tranquil blues, they paint the world, an ever-changing muse.

So let us hail the Chroma Chameleons, in their quest, their journey unfolds, for in the realm of image and light, they reign supreme, a beacon bright.
